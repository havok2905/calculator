## Use

This calculator allows basic math using plus **(+)**, minus **(-)**, multiply **(*)**, divide **(/)**, and equals **(= or Return)**, relying on the browser to complete the order of operations.

To toggle a negative value, enter your number and hold Shift when pressing minus (-). Starting a new equation with an operator will use the previous equation value.

Future expansion of this application will include a working UI of calculator buttons *(Backspace, Clear, Clear All, +/-, ect.)*, the use of parentheses to manage order or operations, and specialty functions like square root & exponents.
