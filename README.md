# Calculator

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.14.0.

To run this project, you will need Node.js/NPM and Bower installed on your system.

## Build & development

Once you clone this repository, run `bower install` and `npm install` from the command line within the directory.

Run `grunt build` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

If a window/tab does not automatically open when running the preview, navigate to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to use the calculator.

## Use

This calculator allows basic math using plus **(+)**, minus **(-)**, multiply **(*)**, divide **(/)**, and equals **(= or Return)**, relying on the browser to complete the order of operations.

To toggle a negative value, enter your number and hold Shift when pressing minus (-). Starting a new equation with an operator will use the previous equation value.

Future expansion of this application will include a working UI of calculator buttons *(Backspace, Clear, Clear All, +/-, ect.)*, the use of parentheses to manage order or operations, and specialty functions like square root & exponents.
